 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file placeholder for anything needed specific to capi_context_stub.
 *
 * It has initially come to exist with nothing in it to satisfy cmake's need for
 * a source file creating an OBJECT library when a need arose to separate the
 * actual context source into a separate object library that did not use the
 * storage_manager_stub
