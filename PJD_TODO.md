Dictionary TODO
===

1. Move things to experimental headers
2. Reject dictionaries if not experimental build?
3. Add lots more CPP API helpers
4. Documentation
5. Tests would be nice
6. Add ostream converter for CPP API Dictionary
7. Reject dictionaries when the attribute type isn't integral
8. Add filters for dictionary? Would require faking Tiles maybe?
